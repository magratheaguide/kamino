# Kamino

This repo acts as a starter for [Magrathea](https://magrathea.guide) projects. It sets up all the tooling, linters, workflows, even directory structures, to enable new projects to get started faster.

More info about what all's in here and how to get up and running coming soon!

## FAQ

### Is this a Jcink "base skin?"

Kamino is not a "base" in the more traditional Jcink coding sense; often when [Jcink](https://jcink.com) coders refer to a "base skin," they're refering to a minimal set of HTML and CSS, including stripped back versions of the Jcink default `wrapper` and `stylesheet`. Magrathea projects toss the Jcink defaults out the window entirely, and in each instance build up HTML and CSS from scratch. Magrathea projects also use various tools to keep code consistent and tidy, and that's what Kamino is meant to set up.
